Hereâ€™s a structured response to the "Share Your Experience" question based on the Furniro E-Commerce Website project.

Experience Overview
Challenges Faced
API Integration Complexity:
Aligning the Sanity CMS schema with the API data structure proved challenging due to inconsistent data formats. This required iterative schema validation and frequent collaboration with the API team.

Performance Optimization:
Achieving optimal performance scores on Lighthouse, especially for mobile users, was demanding. It involved minimizing JavaScript execution time, optimizing images, and implementing efficient caching strategies.

Security Assessments:
Conducting thorough security checks using OWASP ZAP highlighted vulnerabilities in user input validation and API endpoint security, which had to be mitigated.

Data Migration Issues:
Migrating data from legacy systems to Sanity CMS required meticulous mapping and validation, particularly for large datasets where manual intervention was occasionally necessary.

Key Learnings
Importance of Planning:
The initial project setup and planning phase were crucial in setting a strong foundation. Clearly defined goals and well-structured schemas minimized errors during later stages.

Team Collaboration:
Frequent communication and collaboration among the frontend, backend, and QA teams ensured that issues were addressed promptly, reducing overall development time.

Tool Proficiency:
Using tools like Postman, Lighthouse, and React Testing Library enhanced efficiency and accuracy in testing, debugging, and optimizing the project.

Adaptability:
Adapting to challenges, such as addressing unforeseen API limitations or reworking performance strategies, emphasized the value of flexibility in project management.

Suggestions for Improvement
Enhanced Documentation:
Providing detailed API documentation and guidelines for schema alignment at the onset could streamline integration and reduce errors.

Automated Testing:
Incorporating automated testing for both frontend and backend components would save time and ensure consistent reliability.

Performance Benchmarks:
Setting clear performance benchmarks early in the project would help prioritize optimization tasks effectively.

More Iterative Feedback:
Including user feedback loops during the development process could help refine UI/UX elements and align the project closer to user expectations.
